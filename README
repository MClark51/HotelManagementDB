# Hotel California Final Project
#### Author: Marco Clark

## Overarching disclaimer about functionality
To be a tab bit more realistic with my system, I am creating the front desk interface in a way such that you can only check in customers who have a reservation starting on the current day. The current day is THE DAY IN WHICH YOU ARE EXECUTING THE PROGRAM. Of course from the time that I generated my data to the time that you will be testing/grading, some reservations that were booked upon data creation will have become abandoned and there is functionality to see all reservations that were essentially "no-call/no-show" reservations. As one may expect, you can't reserve a room for a previous date and the check-out must be at least 1 day after the check-in. 

## Sources of data
(almost) all data generated on the database was from a java program that I created. It is included in this directory in a specified folder. 

I got random names and addresses for customers and hotels from randomlists.com. I copied batches of data and manually put quotes and parentheses as needed to create String arrays in Java. This wasn't entirely efficient, but it worked and allowed me to then add those Strings into my INSERT queries later on. For the room types, I wrote out each of those queries and executed them in SQL Developer since there weren't too many of them. 

To ensure that I had a memory of which room number was a certain type, I made new objects for Rooms and made an ArrayList of rooms for each hotel as I created the rooms. I then used this list later on when creating reservations and checking customers in.

## Frequent Guest Program
At data generation, all customers were created with 2000 "frequent guest points". Customers can pay for rooms with points and points are accumulated at the end of the stay based on the total cost of the stay. The current accrual rate is 10% of the total cost rounded to the nearest integer.
